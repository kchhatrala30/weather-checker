# weather-checker

Check the weather in a streamlined and personally curated manner with the weather checker.

Begin by entering a location in the text field. After clicking on the info-loading button, select any option from the combo box to display the weather at your location. You can also reenter another location, reload the information, and view the weather for that location as well. To exit the program, select the "Exit" option on the combo box.

For a specified location, you can view the weather "at a glance" (location, day and time, basic status), the current temperature, daily high and low, and view everything together. Soon, moon phases and fog levels will be added to the weather checker.

Check the weather for the entire world in a matter of seconds!
